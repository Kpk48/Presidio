This project involves setting up a db, with supabase for an online db, using mock data to run and uilizing api key to fetch and perform tasks on the data
The project can be run anywhere and will work due to the use of online db when the api details are not modified
 Disclamer: Do not modify the data present in the db. If done so, change queries as required
