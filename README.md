To run the script.py

Dependencies:
Supabase 

Run:
pip install supabase

This project involves setting up a db, with supabase for an online db, using mock data to run and uilizing api key to fetch and perform tasks on the data
The project can be run anywhere and will work due to the use of online db when the api details are not modified
 Disclamer: Do not modify the data present in the db. If done so, change queries as required

The integration.yaml file was for github actions. It helps to automatically merge in case if a pull request is raised or if a developer pushes the code
It should further be developed. It is currently inactive. save it under .github/workflows to make it active and it will merge changes automatically in case of no conflicts. If conflicts are present, resolve it and it will automatically merge once resolved
System design for both high as well as low level is done and will be referenced
